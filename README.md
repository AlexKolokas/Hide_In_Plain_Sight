# HIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT

**H.P.S.** Is a small python script to hide your password in plain sight. It's not supposed to be safe from an expert eye but to confuse the simple people around you.


## How it works
It creates a random string and in random places adds a # . After every # adds a character from your password.
In a very simple example if the password was 123 then it will become #1#2#3 . But we add some randomness. So its like:

## How to 
### Hide your password
- `Save your password in a text document.` 
- `Run the H_P_S script.` 
- `Choose the name of the text file with your password in.` 
- `choose a length for your random string (something like 500).` 
- `choose name to save the new file.` 
- `Run the script.` 

### Recover your password
- `Run the H_P_S_to_pass script.` 
- `Choose the name of the text file you want to recover.` 
- `It will print your password.`
